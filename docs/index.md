# IndexTTS Documentation

Welcome to the IndexTTS documentation!

IndexTTS is a GPT-style text-to-speech (TTS) model mainly based on XTTS and Tortoise. It is capable of correcting the pronunciation of Chinese characters using pinyin and controlling pauses at any position through punctuation marks.

This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up IndexTTS, using its features, and contributing to the project.
